# CSV explorer

Shiny app to explore the data in a CSV file interactively.


### What it does (or will eventually do)

The idea is to allow folks who don't program (or don't want to program) to explore a dataset relatively easily through a simple GUI.  
Once you have picked the basic data types for each column of the CSV (the app tries to pick the correct types to start with, but might fail), the data may be shown in a bunch of ways, by clicking through to the correct tab:
- Data table: should be searchable and subsettable
- Map: if the data contains a latitude and longitude column
- Configurable charts: time series, bar charts
